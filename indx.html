 this is my <strong><em>my dev journey</em></strong>. it's been good so far
 <h2>moving on to the next part</h2>
 Second part is <em>learning to use all elements</em> needed for html
 <!-- Remember comments are used to help identify"last edits" and never visible on the webpage-->
<h3>let's practice the use of links</h3>
 <a href="https://theodinproject/about">the odin project</a>
 <p><a href="https://jumia.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">login to jumia here</a></p>
 <!--Remember to use the target="_blank" to open link in new tab and rel tag for security and privacy noopener:ensures the link is opened in a new tab and the noreferer: makes sure the new tab doesn't know where the user is coming from-->
 <p><a href="pages/index.html">About</a></p>
 <!--note that relative links open tabs in our own website while absolute links opens tab another website -->
<img src="dogpic.jpg" alt="our beautiful puppy" height="310" width="310"> 
<!--img don't need closing tags and ../img are needed when adding an img source on relative links-->
<!--alt is used to describe an image also a good practice to add the width and height in the img tag-->
